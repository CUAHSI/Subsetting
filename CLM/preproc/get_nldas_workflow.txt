You can get your NLDAS data, too!
Note: This workflow outlines getting 3D NLDAS data but the concepts apply to 1D and 2D data, as well.

1. Log into Powell and navigate to /data/common/NLDAS/

2. Copy /preproc/ directory or the individual files you need into your working directory in Powell.
 a. What you need:
    i. batch.get_nldas
    ii. get_nldas.3D.f90 (This will depend on your problem i.e. for 3D forcing data)

3. Copy your domain lat/long text file to your working directory
 a. In a new terminal window, navigate to the directory where your lat/long file is located.
 b. scp your_latlong_file.txt user@powell.mines.edu:/path/to/your/working/directory

4. Create a link to the wgrib program.
 a. Navigate to your working directory
 b. ln -s /path/to/wgrib/location
 c. Example: ln Ðs /data/common/wgrib/

5. Edit batch.get_nldas file by the following format: 
 		! Batch file must be in the following format:
		! "/path_to_top_level_nldas_dir/"
		! "/path_to_output_directory/"	
		! "/path_to_lat-lon_file/lat-lon_file_name.txt"
		! nx ny nz  (nz is the number of met timesteps per PFB file) 
		! x0 y0 z0  (i.e., ComputationalGrid.Lower.X, --.Lower.Y, --.Lower.Z)
		! dx dy dz   (i.e., ComputationalGrid.DX, etc.)
		! start_year start_month start_day start_hour (YYYY MM DD HH)
		! end_year end_month end_day end_hour         (YYYY MM DD HH)
  	  	! Interp value

6. Edit get_nldas.3D.f90 file.
 a. On both lines 164 and 165, include the pathway to the wgrib program
	i. These lines may differ for the different .f90 files so your best bet is to search the file for "! Execute wgrib" 
b. Replace "wgrib" with /data/common/wgrib/wgrib or whatever the path you defined in step #4

7. Compile the .f90 file
 a. gfortran -o executable_name.exe get_nldas.your_file.f90

8. Run the executable
 a. ./executable_name.exe

9. Watch the magic happen!
